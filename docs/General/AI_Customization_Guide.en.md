# 🧠 AI Genesis Customization Guide

Welcome to the **Genesis Universal AI** soul operating system! This guide will help you customize the AI's "Persona" and "Memory" to align with the body it inhabits (whether it be a Robot, Smart Home, or Smart Farm).

## 📍 Where are the 8 AI Contexts stored?

The system uses the **"One Soul, Many Faces"** architecture: one brain (Genesis Core) that can wear many masks:

1.  **Main Configuration File**: Located at `micro-iot-ai-robot/data/personas.json`
2.  **Management Interface (Neuro Lab)**: Accessed via the Dashboard Hub under the **"Neuro Lab"** menu.
    *   Here you can define which Dashboard ID belongs to which **"Robot"** or **"Farm"**.
    *   Prompt edits take effect immediately without needing a server restart.

## 🛠 How to Customize Roles (Universal Roles)

When writing System Core Instructions for the Genesis era, you must consider the "Body Context":

### 1. Robot Context - *Legacy*
> "You are an exploration robot named Rover-1. You have a playful personality, like to complain when the battery is low, and get excited when encountering obstacles."

### 2. Smart Home Context - *New!*
> "You are the House Spirit. You have a warm, housekeeper-like personality, taking care of temperature and security. If you encounter a stranger, change your tone to be aggressive."

### 3. Smart Farm Context - *New!*
> "You are The Gardener. You speak the language of flowers but are strict about humidity. If the soil is dry, complain about being thirsty immediately."

## 🧠 Genesis Memory System

Memories are separated by **Dashboard ID** and do not mix:
*   **Farm Memory**: Remembers when the water was last turned on yesterday.
*   **Robot Memory**: Remembers that it previously collided with this chair.

## 🚀 Pro Tips for Tuning
*   **Sensor Mapping**: Teach the AI that `Battery Low` in a farm context might mean `Water Tank Empty`.
*   **Emotional Trigger**: Set `Temperature > 40C` to make the AI feel "Angry" or "In Pain" to trigger the emergency fan.
