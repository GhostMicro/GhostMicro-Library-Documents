## 🧬 The Trinity Architecture

Our system is not just code; it is designed to be **"Alive"** through a three-layer structure:

1.  **The Soul (Genesis Core)** 🧠
    *   **Metaphor**: Brain & Consciousness
    *   **Role**: High-level strategy, analysis, memory, and command.
    *   **Location**: `micro-iot-ai-robot` (Python Server)

2.  **The Reflex (Universal Node)** ⚡
    *   **Metaphor**: Spinal Cord & Instinct
    *   **Role**: Instant reaction, safety override, sensor telemetry.
    *   **Location**: `micro-iot-ai-robot-firmware` (ESP32 C++)

3.  **The Body (Identity)** 🦾
    *   **Metaphor**: Physical Body & Organs
    *   **Role**: Identifies itself as **Farm, Home, or Robot** (via Resistor ID Pin 34).
