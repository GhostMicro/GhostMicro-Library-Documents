### 📌 Current Objectives
*   **Stage 4: Robotics Integration**: Focus on developing the Navigation System (A*) and Intelligent Radar.
*   **Stage 5: Hardware Enablement**: Establish the Bill of Materials (BOM) and connection standards to accelerate hardware development.

### ⚠️ Precautions
*   Do NOT modify standard GPIO pins specified in the [Hardware BOM](../02_core_iot/Hardware_BOM.md) to ensure Reflex System stability.
*   Adding new sensors must ONLY be done through the Instinct System.
