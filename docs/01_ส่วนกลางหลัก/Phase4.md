# **Phase 4: Virtual World Creation (Digital Twin & Full Automation)**

* **Goal:** Implement bi-directional synchronization between the physical hardware and the 3D Digital Twin, alongside AI-driven predictive maintenance and premium visual diagnostics.
* **Key Achievements:**
    - [x] **3D Digital Twin Sync**: Developed `Ecosystem3D` with real-time mapping of light, moisture, and battery telemetry.
    - [x] **Bi-directional Control**: Interactive 3D models allow toggling real-world actuators (e.g., blinds).
    - [x] **Cyberpunk Aesthetics**: Integrated **Bloom Effects** for a premium Sci-Fi visual experience.
* **Next Milestones:**
    1.  **Predictive Maintenance**: Genesis analyzes historical data to forecast device failures.
    2.  **Autonomous Rule Generation**: Sub-AIs suggest logic optimizations to the Overseer.
    3.  **Ecosystem-wide Safety**: Autonomous local shutdown in case of critical anomalies.
