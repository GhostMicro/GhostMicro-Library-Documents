# 🌐 Core IoT: The Technical Bridge

The **Core IoT** system serves as the technical execution layer and engineering bridge for the GhostMicro ecosystem. It translates the high-level roadmap and logic defined in [**01_ส่วนกลางหลัก (Main Core)**](../01_ส่วนกลางหลัก/Roadmap.md) into physical hardware interactions, standard protocols, and edge intelligence.
